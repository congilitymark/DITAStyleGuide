	 <p>With topic-based documentation, the way in which information is broken
		down and 
		<term>chunked</term> into topics is very important. A user guide with one
		very long topic

		into sections is poorly chunked. Topics should be small, self-contained,
		granular units of content. In general, the smaller the topic size, the greater
		the chance that topic can be re-used in another deliverable document. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>The process of 
		<term>chunking</term> involves

		the components of the information to be documented, identifying the blocks of
		content that can stand alone as information units, and then splitting those
		units into separate 
		<term>chunks</term>. 
	 </p> 
	 <p importance="high">In DITA, standalone

		into topics, sections within topics, or topics within topics. You should aim to
		have separate topics for each chunk, and to avoid sections and composite
		topics. 
	 </p> 
	 <p> Information in a DITA source topic doesn't have to be delivered at the
		same granularity. For example, a family of DITA topics may be output as a
		single HTML topic. (The 
		<synph>chunking</synph> attribute in the 
		<synph>topicref</synph> element in the ditamap is used for this purpose.)
