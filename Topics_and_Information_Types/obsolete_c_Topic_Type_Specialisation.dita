For example, if your new topic type is designed to contain lists of airliner registrations, you may decide you need elements for manufacturer, build number, model number, model name, version number, country of registration, and registration code.</li><li outputclass="listnumber">"Clone" the shell DTD of the base topic type that is the closest match to your new topic type. For example, our airliner registration topic may be a specialised type of reference topic.</li><li outputclass="listnumber">Create a sample document with the mark-up for the new topic type.</li><li outputclass="listnumber">Modify the DTD modules until the sample document validates.</li></ol></conbody></concept>
