  <title>Lists within paragraphs</title> 
  <shortdesc>Whether a list is contained within a paragraph, or whether it
	 occurs as a separate parallel block after the paragraph, depends on the
	 context. If the paragraph contains a lead-in to the list, then that list is
	 bound to the paragraph, and the list should be a child of the paragraph.

	 <p>DITA permits you to use a structure for a list of items where the list
		exists within a paragraph element. You can alternatively create a list
		structure without a surrounding paragraph. In other words, both of the
		following are valid. 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock>&lt;p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point 1&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Point 2&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/p&gt; 
</codeblock> 
	 <p>and 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock>&lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Point 1&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Point 2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</codeblock> 
	 <p>The best choice is the structure that is semantically correct, and that
		will depend upon the context. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>In most cases, the second option (a standalone list structure) is
		correct semantically, because most lists do not logically fall within a
		paragraph, and cannot be logically be surrounded by a paragraph. Further, if
		the paragraph has no content other than the list, then it is probably
		superfluous. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>However, in some cases, the list may logically belong within the same
		idea as the surrounding paragraph. In such cases, there will be text within the
		paragraph element before and/or after the list element. For example: 
	 </p> 
	 <codeblock>&lt;p&gt;The four turbo-charged models are: 
 &lt;sl&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;XRW&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;XRW Super&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;Lumberer XT&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;Liberty GT.&lt;/sli&gt;
 &lt;/sl&gt; 
 &lt;/p&gt;</codeblock> 
	 <p>A more complex example is: 
		<codeblock>&lt;p&gt;The four turbo-charged models 
 &lt;sl&gt;
 &lt;sli&gt;XRW&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;XRW Super&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;Lumberer XT&lt;/sli&gt;
  &lt;sli&gt;Liberty GT&lt;/sli&gt;
 &lt;/sl&gt; 
 are the most expensive of their makes.&lt;/p&gt;</codeblock> 
	 </p> 
	 <p>When considering content re-use, the paragraph in the preceding example
		could be re-used, and would always include the list, as it is part of the same
		idea. The list could also be re-used without the paragraph text. But the
		paragraph text could not be re-used without the list. 
	 </p> 
	 <p>Some people treat lead-in sentences, or stem sentences, in the same way.
		
		<ph importance="high">If a stem sentence ends with a colon, then it
		  should only be re-used with the list it supports. Therefore, the stem sentence
		  and the list should be in the same semantic element.

		<title>Rationale</title> 
		<p>There is mixed opinion on this issue on the DITA forums. One of the
		  strongest views expressed varies from my own views, because I think it doesn't
		  take into account the semantic binding of a stem sentence to its following
		  text. The view that block items should not be used as inline items is a furphy,
		  because there is not neat separation of block and inline in DITA. For example,
		  a list item is a block element, but it appears within an unordered list
		  element, which is a block element. A list is just that: a list. Lists can be
		  inline lists, bulleted lists, or numbered lists. Whether the list is displayed
		  in separate paragraphs or on the one line is a matter for processing, not for
		  authoring. 
		</p> 
		<p>My approach, of allowing lists within paragraphs if the context
		  suggests that, is consistent with other guidelines such as 
		  <xref href="c_Paragraphs_within_Notes.dita#D9149"
		  type="concept" format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Paragraphs (and other block elements) within notes?></xref>
		  and 
		  <xref href="c_Paragraphs_Inside_Tables.dita#D3760" type="concept"
		  format="dita" scope="local"><?xm-replace_text Paragraphs (and other block elements) within tables?></xref>.

		  <p>The next issue (which you didn't mention) is nesting &lt;ul&gt; and
			 other lists inside &lt;p&gt;, such as:

		  <codeblock>&lt;p&gt;Please remember to eat at least two of the 
following every day:
 &lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;apple&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;orange&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;lemon&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;tomatoe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;.&lt;p&gt;</codeblock> 
		  <p>Aside from the messed up output this will generate (unless you code
			 intelligence in the stylesheets to insert punctuation etc) it will have
			 negative translation side effects (is &lt;ul&gt; a block or inline element?) I
			 think we listed &lt;ul&gt; as a block element, so it should not be used as an
			 inline element. I often find users marking up as follows:
